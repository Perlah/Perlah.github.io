		<p>A Poem</p>
	<font  face="Covered By Your Grace">
	<p>From childhood's hour I have not been
	<br>As others were &mdash; I have not seen
	<br>As others saw &mdash; I could not bring
	<br>My passions from a common spring &mdash;
	<br>From the same source I have not taken
	<br>My sorrow &mdash; I could not awaken
	<br>My heart to joy at the same tone &mdash;
	<br>And all I lov'd &mdash; I lov'd alone &mdash;
	<br>Then &mdash; in my childhood &mdash; in the dawn
	<br>Of a most stormy life &mdash; was drawn
	<br>From ev'ry depth of good and ill
	<br>The mystery which binds me still &mdash;
	<br>From the torrent, or the fountain &mdash;
	<br>From the red cliff of the mountain &mdash;
	<br>From the sun that 'round me roll'd
	<br>In its autumn tint of gold &mdash;
	<br>From the lightning in the sky
	<br>As it pass'd me flying by &mdash;
	<br>From the thunder, and the storm &mdash;
	<br>And the cloud that took the form
	<br>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
	<br>Of a demon in my view &mdash;
	<br><mark> &nbsp;Edgar Allan Poe</mark></br></p></font>
