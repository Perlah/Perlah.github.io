	<font  face="font-family: 'Covered By Your Grace', cursive;">
		&nbsp;<p>From childhood's hour I have not been
	<br>As others were -- I have not seen
	<br>As others saw -- I could not bring
	<br>My passions from a common spring --
	<br>From the same source I have not taken
	<br>My sorrow -- I could not awaken
	<br>My heart to joy at the same tone --
	<br>And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --
	<br>Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn
	<br>Of a most stormy life -- was drawn
	<br>From ev'ry depth of good and ill
	<br>The mystery which binds me still --
	<br>From the torrent, or the fountain --
	<br>From the red cliff of the mountain --
	<br>From the sun that 'round me roll'd
	<br>In its autumn tint of gold --
	<br>From the lightning in the sky
	<br>As it pass'd me flying by --
	<br>From the thunder, and the storm --
	<br>And the cloud that took the form
	<br>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
	<br>Of a demon in my view --
	<br> Edgar Allan Poe</br></p></font>
