	<p> Using the HTML elements we discussed in class, create a formal composition that you find beautiful.
	 Each element should be used at least ten (10) times. How can you utilize elements about the web to emphasize emotions or convey ideas?
	 What ideas and interactions are unique to the web? In what ways can use the language of the web to convey these ideas?
	 Consider how the composition changes while the user scrolls and resizes the browser.</p>

		<p>Build an index page for yourself using the structure and tags used in today's lecture.
		Consider how the page could reflect your particular design sensibility. 
		We will be using this page as a springboard to link to the projects you make this semester,
		so think about how the structure could evolve to accommodate a living archive of work.</p>

		<a href="composition3/index.html"><h2>Archive</h2></a>
		<p>Design a web site that archives each classmate's composition from last week’s assignment.
		Your archive should include a static image of each student’s composition and a link to the
		HTML version of the composition. In addition, the following information should also be included:
		title, author, email address, and any other content appropriate to your design. For this
		assignment, you should analyze all of the compositions and decide on an organizing principle that
		your site will be based on—try to find a system more interesting than alphabetical order.</p>
