	<p> Using the HTML elements we discussed in class, create a formal composition that you find beautiful.
	 Each element should be used at least ten (10) times. How can you utilize elements about the web to emphasize emotions or convey ideas?
	What ideas and interactions are unique to the web? In what ways can use the language of the web to convey these ideas?
	Consider how the composition changes while the user scrolls and resizes the browser.</p>

		<p>Build an index page for yourself using the structure and tags used in today's lecture.
		Consider how the page could reflect your particular design sensibility. 
		We will be using this page as a springboard to link to the projects you make this semester,
		so think about how the structure could evolve to accommodate a living archive of work.</p>
